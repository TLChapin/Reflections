Reflections on file compare.
Although FC works, Ultra Compare or many other text editors provide a much better interactive comparison environment.

Reflections on History
Archive and retrieval is much easier.

Git log
Look at submitted stuff.

Pros and Cons of manually chosing commit time.
Pro: Committs shoud be fully functional.
Con: If you forget you may be messed up.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?

Allows coincidental changes to multiple files to be managed with
minimal effort.
