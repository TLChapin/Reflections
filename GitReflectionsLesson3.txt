Git Training Lesson 3 Reflections

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want control of when and what!


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: A "copy" of an existing GitHub repository into your own area.
Clone: A "copy" of an existing repository copied to your local machine.
Brandh: A named "copy" of another branch within your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Offline comparison... online comparison to minimize work required to push/pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Not very well.
